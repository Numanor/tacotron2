'''
Defines the set of symbols used in text input to the model.

The default is a set of ASCII characters that works well for English or text that has been run
through Unidecode. For other data, you can modify _characters. See TRAINING_DATA.md for details.

For Chinese Mandarin, the set of symbols can be switched to Pinyin initials, finals, retroflex (Erhua), 
tones and prosodic structure tags.

The set of symbols can be switched according to language tag in symbols(lang).
